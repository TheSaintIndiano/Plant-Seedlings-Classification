# Introduction

[Based on Kaggle Plant Seedlings Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification)


# Description

Can you differentiate a `weed` from a crop `seedling`?

Classify `an image` of `seedling` into one the following `12 different` seedling `classes`.

1. **Black-grass**
2. **Charlock**
3. **Cleavers**
4. **Common Chickweed**
5. **Common wheat**
6. **Fat Hen**
7. **Loose Silky-bent**
8. **Maize**
9. **Scentless Mayweed**
10. **Shepherds Purse**
11. **Small-flowered Cranesbill**
12. **Sugar beet**


The ability to do so effectively can mean `better crop yields` and `better stewardship of the environment`.

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

We're hosting this dataset as a Kaggle competition in order to give it wider exposure, to give the community an opportunity to experiment with different image recognition techniques, as well to provide a place to cross-pollenate ideas.
